N-light-N uses a modified version of JTransforms:
- We made all non-static classes serializable, so that a network using
  transforms can be saved.
- We removed multi-thread support:
  In some cases (e.g., multiplying all values of an array by a scalar), the
  multi-thread approach is slower, and additionally this can lead to issues
  when running several instances of N-light-N on a computer/cluster.
- We removed the support for large arrays (more than 2^31 elements), which
  were not useful for realistic machine learning methods.
- We removed a large quantity of unused methods.
- We replaced FastMath by Math (benchmarks have shown little or no impact
  on the speed - and sometimes slower programs using FastMath).
These modifications allow the use JTransform without the use of any additional
external library.
