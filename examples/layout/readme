This example illustrates pixel-level layout analysis done using scripts
only. Note that for weight reasons, we use the same image for both
training and test. You can of course use different ones, and if possible
several ones for training if you intend to maximize the accuracy. You
can find full datasets at the following addresses:

You might need to have to process their ground truth in order to have
single-class labels for the pixels.

The ground truth has to be encoded as pixels. The different classes
are:
	0x000000 : out of page
	0x000001 : background
	0x000002 : decorations
	0x000003 : text blocks (without text lines)
	0x000004 : text lines
An example file is provided in the data/ folder, along with its ground
truth.

To run the two example scripts:
	java -Xmx1G -jar N-light-N.jar script-3l.xml
	java -Xmx1G -jar N-light-N.jar script-4l.xml

The output, which appears in result/, displays patches either in green
or red, depending on whether they have been correctly classified or not.
